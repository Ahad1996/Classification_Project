***Stroke Prediction and Data Visualization with Machine Learning***


**Introduction**

Nowadays, stroke is a major health-related challenge
Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident, consists of a neurological disease that can result from ischemia or hemorrhage of the brain arteries, stroke affects about 16 million individuals worldwide and is associated with enormous societal costs , And in this project, we used algorithms that predict whether a stroke will occur or not, according to the health data entered.

**Data Description**

Dataset from KAGGLE.COM and contains 5110 observations × 12 feature

**Used Tool:**

• Technologies:

Jupyter Notebook , Python

• Libraries:

Pandas , Numpy, Matplotlibe, Seaborn , Sklearn 

**Algorithm:**

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

K-Neighbors Classifier

Support Vector Classifier

XGB Classifier


**Questions:**

1. Is age a cause of stroke?
2. Who is more likely to have a stroke male or female?
3. Is smoking a cause of stroke?
